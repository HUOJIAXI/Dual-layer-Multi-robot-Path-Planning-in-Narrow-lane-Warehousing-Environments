**Abstract**:   
  Collision-free path planning is indispensable for the multi-robot system. Existing established multi-robot path planning algorithms may no longer work properly in the narrow-lane warehousing environment. 
  This paper proposes a novel dual-layer algorithm to clear up the multi-robot path planning problem in the narrow-lane warehousing environment. 
  In the first layer, the integer programming technique primarily based on distance metrics balances the optimality of the generated collision-free robotic paths and the computation time of the algorithm. 
  In the second layer, fast feasible heuristics are applied to make sure the solvability of the proposed integer programming approach in the first layer. 
  In the dual-layer algorithm, specific traffic policies for each narrow lane are implemented to generate the collision-free path for every robot whilst maintaining the narrow lane free, besides the collision avoidance approach at the robotic level. 
  With this, robot-robot collision in the narrow lane is avoided, and the algorithm's effectivity in producing collision-free robotic paths increases. 
  Simulation experiments have been launched considerably primarily based on the proposed assessment metrics. 
  Our algorithm suggests a higher overall performance in the narrow-lane warehousing environment when in contrast with the present optimal, sub-optimal, and polynomial-complexity algorithms.
