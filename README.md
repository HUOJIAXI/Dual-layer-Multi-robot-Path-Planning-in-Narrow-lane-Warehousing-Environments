Abstract: Collision-free path planning is essential for the multi-robot system. Existing general multi-robot path planning algorithms do not work well in the narrow-lane warehousing environment. 
    This paper proposes a novel dual-layer algorithm to solve the multi-robot path planning problem in the narrow-lane warehousing environment. 
    In the first layer, the integer programming method based on distance metrics balances the optimality of the generated collision-free robot paths and the computation time of the algorithm. 
    In the second layer, fast feasible heuristics are implemented to ensure the solvability of the proposed integer programming method in the first layer. 
    In the dual-layer algorithm, to generate the collision-free path for each robot while keeping the narrow lane free, besides the collision avoidance strategy at the robot level, particular traffic rules for each narrow lane are implemented. 
    With this, robot-robot collision in the narrow lane is avoided, and the algorithm's efficiency in generating collision-free robot paths increases. 
    Simulation experiments have been launched extensively based on the proposed evaluation metrics. 
    Our algorithm performs better in the narrow-lane warehousing environment when compared with the existing optimal, sub-optimal, and polynomial-complexity algorithms.
